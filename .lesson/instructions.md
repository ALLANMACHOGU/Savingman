## Getting Started

The app/ directory is full of sample code you should read and try to understand. Go to app/index.ts and try uncommenting some sections one at a time to see how the different examples work.

## Now Make Your Own "Hello World"

Now it's time to get one of your own sprites working. You should work step-wise to build up complexity as you go.

1. Get your image loaded on the canvas (see my image example)
2. Get it so only one frame of the image at a time loads correctly (see my plain sprite example).
3. Get it so the sprite animates either automatically or in response to user events (see my event or timer examples).
4. Done early? Try adding multiple sprites, a moving background, or integrating multiple kinds of movement into an animation loop.
